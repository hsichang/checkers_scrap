# Checkers

## Note this repo has been deprecated!

This game was originally built solely using .js, jQuery and html.  It has since been moved to the checkersApi repo where it now exists.

All of the game logic rests there under app/assets/javascripts/checkers.js

Deprecated description:
-----------------------

Build a chat room and play checkers with a friend, or, play solo against a simulated opponent.

More documentation to come as the code is sorted out.
